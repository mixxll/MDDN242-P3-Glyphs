### Color Glyphs

Concept One - Code

I have coded the first of my concepts, that being the radial design. The glyph functions as expected, however upon the transition of going from a hue of 360 back to 0, the glyph jumps back to a dot, with no smooth transition between the two. This will hopefully be changed in further updates.

The glyph functions very well in both the gradient and outlier modes, with the gradient showing a clear flow and the outlier being easily detectable.
