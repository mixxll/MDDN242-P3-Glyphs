### Color Glyphs

I have 3 sketches to begin this project, with each one interpreting the colour in a different way, the first sketch is seen below. 

This sketch takes the Hue value and interpreted it as an angle, this angle is then used to determine the length of an arc around a circle. The radius of this circle is determined by the saturation of the colour, so a colour with no saturation will appear as a dot. Lastly the stroke of the arc is determined by the lightness value, so that darker colours use a thicker stroke, which in turn should give the glyph a darker appearance.
