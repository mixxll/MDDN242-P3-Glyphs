### Color Glyphs

Developed Sketch Two

I have fleshed out my code for this design, with the wave now using a simplar code that also allows it to be a single line rather than the two lines that were mirrored beforehand.

Upon looking at the code in random and gradient mode, it is clear that the mapping of values isnt as accurate as I had intiially percieved them to be, with a cyan colour appearing as a flat line, when initally black was meant to display like that.

This should be a relativley easy fix, just a matter of switching the different inputs for each map and altering the limits slightly.
