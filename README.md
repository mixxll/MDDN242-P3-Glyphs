### Color Glyphs

Further Development - Concept Two

- Refined glyph to more or less a final state, fixed few minor details, such as moving start and points for the wave out a bit so glyph wave is cleaner/smoother.

- Added a outline of sorts to background circle, by increasing fill lightness by 5 and drawing a smaller circle in the exsisting one.
