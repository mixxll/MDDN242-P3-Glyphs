### Color Glyphs

Final Design - Wave Glyph


The final design for my glyph can be seen above.

// Glyph Description 

The design uses wave geometry to convey colour through a monochrome glyph. With each value from the HSL colour value controlling an aspect of the glyph.

Hue - Controls the rotation of the glyph, thus making it so that the waves of colours with the same hue when next to each other will appear to connect and form one larger wave.

Saturation - Controls the number of peaks in the wave, so a higher saturation creates a more intense wave, and a colour with no saturation will only have the one point.

Lightness - Controls the amplitude of the wave, with colours of zero lightness i.e. black, appear as a flat line. The lightness also controls the background circles lightness. This helps the glyphs be easily differentiable.

Overall I was quite happy with how the glyph turned out, similar colours are easy to find and the oddball can be found with relative ease. After looking at the final design, it does come across as quite simple due to the only real visual elements that change being the wave, but ultimately that fits with my initial goal of a simple yet effective glyph.

// Process Summary

I knew from the start that I wanted a simple glyph that was still easy to read, therefore my three initial concepts were quite simple in design but still communicated colour efficiently. Out of my three concepts I decided to choose the one that I believed would be the most challenged to code, and therefore be the more rewarding.

After beginning the code I realised the basics of the design were quite simple, it was the details that proved to be more difficult, such as creating a single wave, rather than the two mirrored waves.

The value mapping was also changed upon development, as the initial design didn't convey colour as I intended, with black not appearing as a flat line for example.

Lastly the implementation of the background helped further the communication of colour through a direct visual communication of the colours lightness.
