### Color Glyphs

Concept Three - Radial with Angle Lines

The last of my concepts can be seen above, this concept was relatively easy to code, as it is just a slight variation on my first design, the hardest part was getting the lines to be tangential to the arc, but once that was solved the code was more or less finished.

The added addition of the tangential lines adds to the flow when in gradient mode, making each glyph appear like a clock face which I quite like.

Once again, similar to the first concept the glyph jumps when transitioning back to 0 from 360, this will need to be looked into.
