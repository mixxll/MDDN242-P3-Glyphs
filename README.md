### Color Glyphs

Concept Two - Wave

The above code shows the start of my second concept, this proved to be quite the challenge to code, however I have managed to get it to a decent start, despite the few changes that need to be made, such as how the two waves do not connect to form the one wave for the glyph. Also the hue map needs to be altered so that the colder hues have a smaller wave height, and the warmer colours have a taller wave.

Other than those two changes I am very happy with how this concept turned out for the most part, now its just a matter of fixing the errors and developing from there.
