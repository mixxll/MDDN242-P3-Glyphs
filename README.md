### Color Glyphs

Further Development - Concept Two

I have fixed the issues I had with the data not mapping in the clearest way, with the hue now determining a rotational value, this might be changed later as I am looking into trying to map it more efficiently.

From here I plan to explore aesthetic choices that aid in the communication of colour through the glyphs.
