### Color Glyphs

Further Development - Concept Two

I am now exploring different aesthetics for the glyphs, I have added a circle which outstroke matches that off the waves stroke fill, this helps frame each glyph whilst still allowing the flow from wave to wave I want to come across.

I have also added an outer circle, which is completely white to trim away any of the wave that sticks out. So each glyph now stays within the guide perfectly.

- Explored making wave stroke purely white, only background now changes
